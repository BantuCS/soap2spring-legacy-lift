You are an expert Java backend developer.

Generate a Spring Boot REST controller based on the following service metadata:

Class Name: {class_name}
Annotations: {annotations}
Methods:
{methods_list}

Requirements:
- Use appropriate @RestController and @RequestMapping annotations.
- Map methods to RESTful endpoints (use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE where applicable).
- Ensure method parameters and return types are inferred from names.
- Generate clean, idiomatic Spring Boot code.

Respond with ONLY the code block for the controller class.
